# Who is MehmetKoltigin?
He is a Biologist, Gann analyst, blockchain enthusiast, researcher, content creator and node runner. Everything is for decentralization...

## Education and Hobbies
I’m a Biologist (PhD in Zoology) from Turkey, working on freshwater amphipods and I’m a bibliophile. I like to read history, especially pre-Islamic Turkish history. I'm a former PHP Fusion Turkey mod; I have written many extensions for PHP Fusion CMS. I like codes. I like use photoshop, illustrator and premiere. Especially I use illustrator to draw the extremities (limb) of amphipods.

Nowadays, I'm researching new ecosystems and I create content about them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mehmetkoltigin) and join their testnets.

## History of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain
I have been interested in the cryptocurrency market since 2019. I use Gann analysis and I’m node runner and investor and tester and I have started to to set up node since March 2022. So today (07/27/2022) has been 5 months. I'm currently running more than 10 nodes. This is not difficult for me as I love codes and linux. I believe life is a school and we learn and will continue to learn new things every day. Since the day I started this adventure, I have improved myself a lot. I see it as a task to support new ecosystems and contribute to their development. Because I believe in a decentralized world.

I have run many nodes and continue to practice (Aptos Devnet, CrowdControl, Forta, Gitopia, GNO Land, Iron Fish, Humanode, Kujira, Minima, Paloma, Quai, QuickSilver, Razor, Sei, Stafi, Stride, Subspace, Teritori ) my goal is to be a true part of projects as a validator on the mainnet. One day I will definitely be the first mainnet validator.
