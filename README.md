# Who is MehmetKoltigin?
Biologist, Gann analyst, blockchain enthusiast, researcher, content creator node runner and Co-Founder of the [Anatolian Team](https://github.com/AnatolianTeam). Everything is for decentralization...

## Education and Hobbies
I’m a Biologist (PhD in Zoology) from Turkey, working on freshwater amphipods and I’m a bibliophile. I like to read history, especially pre-Islamic Turkish history. I'm a former PHP Fusion Turkey mod; I have written many extensions for PHP Fusion CMS. I like codes. I like use photoshop, illustrator and premiere. Especially I use illustrator to draw the extremities (limb) of amphipods.

Nowadays, I'm researching new ecosystems and I create content about them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mehmetkoltigin) and join their testnets.

## History of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain
I have been interested in the cryptocurrency market since 2019. I use Gann analysis and I’m node runner and investor and tester. I'm currently running more than 10 nodes. I see it as a task to support new ecosystems and contribute to their development. Because I believe in a decentralized world.

I have run many nodes and continue to practice (Aptos Devnet, CrowdControl, Forta, Gitopia, GNO Land, Iron Fish, Humanode, Kujira, Minima, Paloma, Quai, QuickSilver, Razor, Sei, Stafi, Stride, Subspace, Teritori) my goal is to be a true part of projects as a validator on the mainnet. One day I will definitely be the first mainnet validator.
